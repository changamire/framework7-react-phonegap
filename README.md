# Framework7 v3 React Phonegap
To get started, clone this repository as whatever you want to name your app:

```
git clone https://github.com/changamire/framework7-react-phonegap.git my-app
```

Running the app, local dev server with live reload:

```
npm install
npm run start
```

To build your app for deployment, run:

```
npm run build
```

The www folder will then contain all of your app's files, optimized and ready for deployment.

To build the app for iOS and Android, you can zip the output www directory and upload the archive to 

[https://build.phonegap.com/](https://build.phonegap.com/)

Or install Phonegap locally and build deployable artifacts there.
